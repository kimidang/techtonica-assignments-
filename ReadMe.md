Guess My Number
Make a web page that generates a secret random number and the user can guess the number until they get it right. For each guess, the game should display whether the answer is higher, lower, or correct.

Extensions:

Track how many wrong guesses the user has made so far and display that count
Track what numbers the user has already guessed and display those
Let the user choose the range of the secret number
